# Furniture - Ecommerce app for buying furniture
I built this app as a capstone project when I was student at University.
While it does not have many features, it uses many sought-after technologies such as NodeJS, GraphQL, TypeScript, React Native and MongoDB.

## Backend stack
 - NodeJS / ExpressJS
 - GraphQL / [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
 - MongoDB / Mongoose
 - JWT authentication 
 - Sendgrid for sending emails
